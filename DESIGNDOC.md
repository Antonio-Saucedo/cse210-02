## The Plan

We are going to use two classes the first one called Card this will represent the cards, and the second one called Director this will represent the player. The following are the structure for the our classes:

Card
---------------------------
| - value
| - cardsuit
---------------------------
| + getValue()
| + getCardSuit()
---------------------------

Director
---------------------------
| - play
| - guess
| - points
| - card1
| - card2
----------------------------
| + startGame()
| + getInputs()
| + results()
| + playAgain()
----------------------------
