# Hilo
Are you ready for a fun time? Come and try Hilo and you won't regret it. The rules are simple. We
show you a value card, between 1 and 13, and you guess if the next card is of higher or lower
value. You start the game with 300 points and if you guess correctly you are awarded 100 points
but be careful because if you guess wrong you lose 75 points. The game ends when your score is
down to 0 or if you choose to take your points with you.

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and 
browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
python3 hilo
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the hilo folder and click the "run" button.
