Purpose
The purpose of this activity is to develop and demonstrate your mastery of the following competencies.

Design software using the principles of programming with classes.
Design a program using the principle of abstraction.

Develop Your Competency
Prepare to Design
Arrange a one hour synchronous meeting with your development team. Online students should coordinate a video-sharing meeting. Campus students will use class time for this meeting. Choose one person to act as team leader and create a remote repository called cse210-02.

Design the Program
Gather with your team at the appointed time and place. Make sure everyone has successfully setup the project on their personal computer. Design the classes and algorithms for your game. Refer to the game specification again if you need to.
Follow these suggestions if you're unsure how to design a program together.

Verify Your Work
Make sure that your design choices have been documented and pushed to the remote repository. Verify that each person has refreshed their local repository with the changes. Lastly, make sure that everyone knows what their coding assignments are.

Demonstrate Your Mastery
Write a short answer response to the following question. Submit your work through I-Learn when you are finished. Remember, you can try as many times as you need, anytime throughout the course, in order to demonstrate your mastery of these competencies.

How did you apply abstraction in your program's design?
Remember to illustrate your answer using examples from design materials that you personally contributed or directly collaborated on.
